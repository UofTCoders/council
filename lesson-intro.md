## UofT Coders Lesson Introduction

In order to welcome new and returning members to each session, and let them know some important 
information before we start our lessons, an "Intro Speaker" will go through the following 
at the start of each session (1-2min), before we do introductions.

1. Welcome everyone, and remind people what lesson this is and what UofT Coders is (a student 
group aimed at building a community for sharing programming skills for research, we hold weekly 
sessions, everyone is welcome etc.)
2. We have a Code of Conduct which can be found on our website.
3. Thank MADLab for hosting us (Mobile App Development Lab, with 3D printers and VR Set)
4. Invite people to join our Gitter (https://gitter.im/UofTCoders/Lobby) to post questions/comments 
during the lesson, and remind them to sign the attendance sheet
5. If people would like to instruct or get involved, they can talk to the Intro Speaker 
or any other exec (get exec present to raise hands).
6. Lead into introductions, start with yourself and go around the room.
7. Hand off to instructor to start lesson.

## UofT Coders Online Lesson Introduction

1. Welcome everyone, and remind people what lesson this is and what UofT Coders is (a student
group aimed at building a community for sharing programming skills for research, we hold weekly
sessions, everyone is welcome etc.)
2. We have a Code of Conduct that can be found on our website (and [here][conduct] directly)
3. We usually hold our events at MADLab, who have kindly hosted us, and look forward to holding 
events there again one day! 
4. Invite people to join the Gitter (link above) _or_ Discord (https://discord.gg/ud984rW9vK) to post 
questions/comments.
5. If people are not on our email list and would like to be, please PM a helper on Zoom. 
6. If people would like to instruct, know more, or get involved, they can talk to the Intro Speaker
or any other exec (who should all be Zoom co-hosts at this point).
7. Zoom-specific logistics:
    - Mention that if people have questions during the lesson, we encourage interrupting the lesson to ask them, or writing them into 'Everyone' chat in Zoom. 
    - Review how to use the 'raise hand' feature in Zoom for participants. 
    - Encourage using 'Everyone' chat for all questions/comments instead of PM'ing the instructor or a helper/exec. 
    - Ask participants not to record without permission (i.e. let us know in advance of a future lesson if you'd like to) 
    - Mention we will be providing relevant links in the Zoom chat throughout the lesson, including a feedback form at the end.
7. Lead into introductions - either do these alphabetically using the list of participants or have participants 
raise hands on Zoom.
8. Hand off to instructor to start lesson.
