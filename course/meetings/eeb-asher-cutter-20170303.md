# Action items

## Everyone
- Send your CV to Madeleine, who will forward all at once to Asher.
    - Indicate whether you have passed your qualifying exam to become a PhD Candidate.
- Read the summary below and modify at will.

## Madeleine
- Check with Ahmed if his prof is co-appointed with EEB and interested in being the appointed faculty for the seminar course.
- Send CVs to Asher, and mentioned Ahmed's prof in case he is interested.

## Luke and Lina
- Unofficial workshops might be the easiest way to reach grad students. Luke and Lina are on two of the grad unions, look into possibility to host something further down the road.

# Summary
- EEB is interested in approaching the university for starting a track in quantitative biology for undergrads. The RQM course slots in perfectly.
- Too late to institute a new course for next year (should apply one year in advance), but it could be possible to launch a session within their seminar courses. We would be able to either teach the full RQM course or most of it coupled with some readings etc.
    - It is unlikely that we will be the instructors on paper. Potentially one of us co-instructors or all of us TAs. It will be easier practically to just have a prof or Asher down on the paper.
    - There are around 15-20 people in these courses, and they run for 2-3 hours. This is similar to Christie's initial course design.
    - Student background: STAT220, so they have some R familiarity. Some of them: EB225 intro biostats in R, or PSY intro stats class 201/202 some R in the latter.
    - This would also serve as a pilot for a potential full RQM course to be launched in 18/19 the earliest. For a potential full course, Asher wants us to ponder: 1. What would be the target audience? 2. What's the scalability of this course, interesting to know for the department.
- Graduate students can not teach other graduate students, the course will be for undergrads.
- They seem to want one person to be the main responsible, no matter how many of us are actually involved.
- Enrollment: EEB specialists are required to fulfill 2 of three things: Field course, seminars, and a research project course. These students would get priority enrollment.
- We would need to attract students. Small group classes are when students like signing up with a prof they want to interact with closer, or a topic they want to get into.
    - When talking to other departments, mention EEB and see if there is interest to co-host or at least advertise in order to attract sufficient number of students
- Many of the interested  students will probably be doing the 4th year research project, so they might be able to bring their own project to class.
    - Fourth year research projects last all academic year, so it would be better for people to get these skills early, but they would have data in hand for the second semester...
    - Range of experience could be really wide, some do computational projects, some don't at all.
- Asher will check with a few profs in EBB that might be interested in being the appointed faculty for the seminar course. He will also look into the departmental regulations more closely regarding the possibility of actually running this as a seminar course and get back to us. In the meanwhile we should forward our CVs to him.

# Full notes (provided as is...)
- Asher is the new chair since January.
- They will want to pitch a undergrad major program in quantitative biology.
    - Since life sciences have minimal of these courses currently.
    - Also for all the premeds that will NOT become medical doctors
    - Some basic quantitative skills are useful in whatever students end up doing.
- Practical considerations
    - A year in advance for proposing new course. So too late for next year.
    - Graduate students fully teaching... will not work to other graduate students for sure. Might not work for undergrads. Although he thinks UofT might be a little bit prone to want to have PhD holders teach the courses.
    - Selling point: interdisciplinary nature, grad student initiated ntead of imposed upon. And ties into some of their existing goals. Continuation of course in the UofT coders group.
    - Near term: Possible to join for seminar course.
        - One semester, two profs, pressing papers, short assignments.
        - We could do a version of that, potentially combined with some of the elements that already exists in the courses.
        - Not sure if we can be the instructors on paper, it might be easier practically to just have a prof or Asher down on the paper.
    - Could also be a field course, ~2 profs that are team leaders, then us as co-instructors. Might be hard to get everyone in that position. lessthan 20 students. During summer for two weeks.
    - PhD student intiiated workshops, bioinformatics themeed for toehr grad students. 6 weeks once a week, get together intro to things. Soudns similar to what we are doing in UofT coders. Department really appreciates these initiatives.
    - They had some student involved in lpyladies, stapehnie something that he brought up
- Logistical thing: seminar course once a week for 2 or 3 hours, similar to what Christie had. He will look into timeliness on getting the seminars started. Not sure that he can get a computer lab.
    - Could there be student accessibility issues with not having computers.
    - Their department might have a collection of laptops, that could be made available.
    - Their undergrads have taking STAT220, so they have some R familiarity. EB225, intro biostats also R. PSY intro stats class 201/202, some R in the latter.
        - So since they have R background, that might be the appropriate lang to use. This is also what we can expect in terms of background. Two semesters of Math algebra, calculus.
        - A few might have an intro CS class.
- Many of the interested  students will prob be the ones doing 4th years research project, so they might be able to bring their own project. 
    - Some of their projects are very computational, genomics etc. Some are more collected data and then the data analyses comes in the end. 
    - Range of experience could be really wide.
    - Enrollment: EEB specialist required to fulfill 2 of three thigns: Field course, seminars, and a reasearch project course. These students would get priority enrollment. 
    - We need to attract student. Small group classes are when students like signing up with a prof they want to interact with closer, or a topic they want to get into. So we need to put ourselves aside.
    - He is willing to make the effort. Although he can't make any gurantees that it will worked. Asked about if we are shopping around.
        - If it is a new course (wouldn't be the case now), it could be a jointly offfered course, they have some with the HMB, CSB and mAth program already. 
        - If it is easier to make it 
        - Maybe other people are interested in promoting it in there program. Make sure it is explicit that this counts towards their course requirements. Just need to let the right people know that the exception should be made.
        - His seminar coruse probably is not a program requirement anywhere else than at EEBB, probably other deparmtents could have some similar coruses Special Topics in X, that we could make them slot this into if we need to get more students.
- He is in the process of putting together the quantitative program and need higher level courses to tie into the basic CS etc courses. He didn't find too many of these around campus.
- Will RU? Shared grad student, that he has mentioned this to.
- Asher thinks CS is tricky, because their undergrads pay higher fees. Restricted enrollment, might be hard to get a course cross appointment with them.
- There might be student that are not on the right level to take the course... crappy students.
- GRAD components: someone in SGS said basically no chance for us teaching grad. In humanities this could become a problem,student equity...
- More unofficial workshops might be the easiest way to reach grad students. Luke and Lina on two of these.
- If it actually comes from the grad students itself it could get more traction than all these departmental emails being sent around.
- Fourth year research projects last all academic year, so it would be better for people to get these skills early, but they would have data in hand for the second semester.
- 6 of interested in teaching
    - Special case to offer course with fewer than 20 students or it gets cancelled.
    - It would probably be fine, but unheard of with that many instructors.
    - No way their department would pay the salary for 6 people.
    - Not only rotating series of people, needs to be continuity.
        - Nobody knows what is going on, someone who is a guaranteer.
    - There might have to one person on paper and then divided equally. Logistically it is easier with prof on paper
    - Nicole mattheus, malaria statisticion population dynamics (teaching seminar course this year)
    - Enil aggrewall, theoritician
    - Ben gilbert, stats modeling, secologist
    - Mauricia Enfortans, ecologist stats, spatial animal disparese.
    - Marty curkosic population ecologist, fisheries growth models, salmon seal isce on the west coast.
    - John stinscom sta geneticist
    - Asher is trying to get marty and john to coteach another course theo eeoclgy and evoution.
    - Luke mauller (lizard guy) some geneticsR-packages (teaches a smeinar course also)
    - Spencer barrtet(taught a smeinar course)
    - Mega fredricsen (seminar)
- The seminar course would be run and this would be a separate session that students could choose.
    - If we shoehorn it in through this mechanism, it would be as a pilot for a course in the fall.
    - New course would be for the 18/19 year. The proposal would need to come in already this fall, so they first months would if we run a seminar course in the fall would be used as the feedback from the first couple of months.
- The department already offers the most courses in the fall, but pedagogically would be better in the fall.
- Aside: stat490 statistic consulting, their students consult with undergrad students in other departments.
- pay logistically easiest as TAs. must check with union conventions, CUPE. Maybe prof in name + co-instructor. Then these positions would have to be posted and we apply for them. Not a big issue according to him.
- He needs to check with the peeps in the know, hasn't yet.
- What would be the target audience if we were to teach a course for real?
- Scalability? Interested to know for the department.
- Feel free to mention Asher and that they are interested. He has already been in touch with CSB francois, they already have so many undergrad courses. Workarounds, 200 level with no workarounds, CS could have 200 level course available for other department, but then there are issues with the extra pay etc.
    - sk them to get in touch with Asher also
- joint program in genome biology, cellsystemsbio, mogen, these students might be interested since they are already more itneo it. Biochem has a specialist progam in bioinfo etc. But both these are more genomics etc. Applied stats course for different streams of sciences, these students might be interested also.
- Should not be any legal issues having this course under UofT coders (for intellectual commons). Anyone can make their course material and make it publicly available.
    - Small class might be easier to control in terms of material etc.
- He will ask other departments to advertise this seminar to get enough students.
