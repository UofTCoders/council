## Meeting Agenda, Jan 12 2022

Present: Frances, Haidy, Ahmed, Tara, Vicki, Elliott

Regrets: Margot, Amin

1. **Upcoming winter plans** (15-20 min)

- how are we feeling in a post-Omicron world? how does it affect how we want this semester to go? 
    - Frances: could make things once a month, or stick to biweekly things with lesson vs co-working stuff
    - Vicki: wouldn't be super useful if we reused last semester's lessons - might be better to do more co-working sessions and/or more mentorship stuff with a few lessons sprinkled in
    - Frances: also finds co-working during the day a little better - hard to keep working with other people past 6
    - Tara: co-working during the day might also be good during the day when everyone's home
- survey results and resulting schedule - to plan out
- last meeting, discussed doing alternating weeks again (one week for mentorship stuff, one week for a lesson, etc) 
- this time - not many survey responses - will pick out things we're interested in and just assemble a schedule


2. **Format** (5-10 min)

- continuing on Discord based on last meeting - some changes to institute:
    - always send out @everyone pings
    - need to update CoC to include 'background noises' as part of disruptive behaviour that could lead to you being muted
    - need to remind people that they can turn people up or down - add to intro spiel
    - need to push the feedback form more
        - instructors asked to wrap up 5 min prior
        - Haidy gift card idea - could look into Discord bots that log messages and then 'eat' them to keep track of who submitted the form if so
    - Frances: make an intro slide and just have it up as people join

3. **Carpentries and Mentorship** (30 min)

- Peer mentorship (Haidy and Tara)
    - signups overview and thoughts so far
        - Haidy: 8 people signed up, half split between mentors/mentees (hooray!)
        - planning to send a reminder that got missed - but we can send an email extending it now that people are getting back to work
        - Tara: maybe extending one more week - since last week was still the world barely getting back on track - now we can try cross-promoting with listservs as well
        - could send out those emails this week and close it next week? 
        - Frances: could also consider doing it in waves - having a second batch of signups after the fact - worried a bit about delaying it too far
        - Haidy: if we're going to extend, we shouldn't extend too far - but leaning towards not delaying unless it's just a couple days max
        - Tara: could send out an email tomorrow saying we'll take signups till Friday? gives us time to plan an event up to two weeks from now
        - Haidy: sounds good - Vicki will forward earlier blurb back to the listserv as a final reminder
        - Vicki/Haidy: we should also send out a Discord ping when we send out the email
    - session planning
        - Frances: sessions will involve the full groups so that people can get diverse viewpoints
        - Haidy: at least three mentor/mentee meetings required - could count the co-working sessions towards that 
    - kick-off event
        - Tara: potentially send out gift cards - could increase turnout - otherwise we could do games
        - Haidy: good for the week of the 24th - in this case we'll extend signup till the 19th - in which case kickoff will be Wed Jan 26th
        - could open with a mentorship program only event followed by a games night
- Carpentries (Frances)
    - also 'Git as portfolio' workshop
    - Frances: will follow up with Elizabeth at UTM since this workshop might not happen at the end of Jan given short timeframe
    - not a Coders event but could have Coders involvement and have it lead into the Carpentries event, which _will_ be a Coders event
    - will hold Carpentries partway through the semester, don't want to get into it too early
        - thinking about holding it the week of Feb 21, eg reading week
    - leaning towards doing Python 
    - happening online of course
    - will touch base when more details come in - but was pretty easy to set up online since there was no room booking + catering

4. **Miscellaneous** (5 min)

- any other matters arising
