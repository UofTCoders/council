## Meeting Minutes, Sept 22 2020

Present: Frances, Margot, Haidy, Ahmed

Regrets: Elliott, Amin

1. **Taking stock of exec + roles**
 * several folks on last year's council have had to step away from Coders given circumstances
    * Frances - happy to be involved with special events, as well as social media/emails/etc
    * need to reach out to Amin about treasurer role again
    * Margot - happy to continue in admin role
    * Haidy - happy to continue working on peer mentorship
 * need to discuss what roles we'll have on council for this year, especially considering the pivot to fully online sessions
    * Frances - should create/amend a role (eg special events) to explicitly involve liaising with U of T Libraries

2. **Fall 2020 schedule**
 * discussing lesson frequency + length
    * weren't able to discuss this as much this time given time constraints
 * lightning demos/something similar every other week? 
    * consensus seems positive
 * discussing optimal online teaching format
    * The Carpentries have put out recommendations and best practices for online code-along teaching

3. **Other initiatives**
 * where are we at with peer mentorship?
    * Haidy - hoping to get it started again, feels it's needed 
    * peer mentorship earlier this year kind of fell apart given covid and we need to think about how to run things online
    * Haidy will also send a follow up email with last year's mentors to ask what they liked and what could be improved
 * should we get creating a resources page started up again? 
    * Frances - we should revisit making a survey and sending it out because so many things are online now
 * opening social - could be a 'virtual conference' type thing where Coders exec and others show the work they do and how

4. **U of T libraries**
 * *note: weren't able to get to this in time - to cover next time*
 * we ought to check in with where they're at re: Carpentries lessons
 * at UTM, there's been a push from the RGASC to get Coders-like workshops going - are there similar initiatives downtown?
