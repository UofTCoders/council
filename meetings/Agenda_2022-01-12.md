## Meeting Agenda, Jan 12 2022

1. **Upcoming winter plans** (15-20 min)

- how are we feeling in a post-Omicron world? how does it affect how we want this semester to go? 
- survey results and resulting schedule - to plan out
- last meeting, discussed doing alternating weeks again (one week for mentorship stuff, one week for a lesson, etc) 

2. **Format** (5-10 min)

- continuing on Discord based on last meeting - some changes to institute:
    - always send out @everyone pings
    - need to update CoC to include 'background noises' as part of disruptive behaviour that could lead to you being muted
    - need to remind people that they can turn people up or down - add to intro spiel
    - need to push the feedback form more
        - instructors asked to wrap up 5 min prior
        - Haidy gift card idea - could look into Discord bots that log messages and then 'eat' them to keep track of who submitted the form if so

3. **Carpentries and Mentorship** (30 min)

    - signups overview and thoughts so far
