Present: Vicki, Yeshoda, Madeleine, Sophie, Ahmed, Elliot;

Regrets: Margot


## Availability & energy for this semester

Vicki: busy, but same amount of busy, preparing for a field season and a committee meeting in April

Yeshoda: busier, but might be too early to judge; taking a class downtown with tests/exam; getting started in the lab; may have some free days

Sophie: same level as last semester, maybe more time if no co-working

Madeleine: very busy, TAing 2 courses, taking 2 courses, trying to finish

Ahmed: adjusting to work, picked up a lot especially in Q1, busier than last semester but less mentally fried

Ahmed has checkbook for Madeleine to sign off on receipts next week for Sophie (co-working session)

## Survey Results & Future Scheduling

Last semester was the first one back, but attendance was awful (read: zero). 

Love EasyRetro -  more responses than previous surveys (i.e., 4 ticks on some things)
- difficult to check how many people total responded, but results below reflect survey results

### Lessons

Survey

- Python relatively more popular
    - data vis with Python, intro to bas, Numpy & Pandas, Machine Learning
    - data vis with R also popular, but ran it last semester so skipping it this time
- no one put down new lessons

Weekly or reduce to bi-weekly and/or make lessons longer?

- stick to 4 lessons, maybe 5 if there’s another interesting topic
    - data vis with Python, intro to bash, Numpy & Pandas, Intro to Machine Learning
- Start Feb 1, stick with biweekly?
- **Ahmed to draft lessons schedule, drop in Discord, and assign instructors (maybe external)**
- Move timeslot and/or record lessons?
    - recording lessons may make things easier, but will need to stream it & then save it; however, streams cannot be saved on Discord
    - Sophie: difficult to tell who answered the survey question and if they attended previous lessons, plus there is a backlog of Coders videos already on the YouTube; however, great idea to record new lessons
    - stick to Wednesday at 6 PM - works for us and almost all respondents

N.B., RGASC hosting a 2-hour Intro to Python workshop, taught by Madeleine

- with pizza
- Coders can support and send out info in a lesson reminder email

### Co-working

Got very few responses about this

- timing didn’t work for one respondent (interesting as there were 2 different times)
- one responded not interested in co-working sessions
- but! someone asked for support outside of workshop hours … but … that’s literally … co-working. confusion

Given these results, should we continue with co-working?

- Sophie: no for this semester. However, to promote co-working in the future or on the Discord, could publish more information on the website about how to ask for support/help on the Discord
    - Ask Elliot about putting Discord information more front & centre (e.g., “Click here for help!”)
    - can offer help still, even if it’s not during co-working sessions
- on Discord: can ping @everyone in help channels to point them to the correct channel and engage them again

In-person or virtual?

- currently running this semester as BAU
- in-person lessons used to be pretty well-attended, but most attendance last semester was online
    - Sophie: okay with 100% virtual, unless there are snacks
    - Vicki: lol same ^
- Madeleine: do we have a food budget?
    - we have money for snacks, but probably not for stuff like pizza
    - need to check with BMO
- can try to pick out 1-2 lessons that are in-person with snacks (possibly food)
    - Vicki: I like this idea
    - Yeshoda: will the lessons with the most demand be online or in-person? Should this be factored in? Will try to put some posters up downtown
    - Ahmed: first lesson? Virtual to help us get our footing, or in-person to try to get a large reach

## Libraries & MadLAB

May Chan (contact at UTM Libraries, spearheaded Carpentries workshops, instructor training, etc.) asked Ahmed & Frances for a meeting

- Coders slowed down on running Carpentries, especially as Libraries is running many events
- however, not all sunshine & rainbows
    - some internal resistance - some Librarians do not like Carpentries material, teaching methodology, etc.,
    - some politics regarding who goes through Instructor training, but some other folks want it to be open to UofT externally
    - Plus, May needs to apply for funding every year
- May is having trouble keeping this up
    - originally, we were hoping that Libraries will be around to keep something like UofT Coders running (events, workshops, trianing etc.) if UofT Coders attendance goes down
    - several people are not following up on Carpentries training checkout process either
    - May hopes that they can send some new Instructors to UofT Coders to keep them engaged and ontrack with workshop instructing
