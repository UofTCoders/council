## Meeting Agenda, Dec 5 2022

1. **Social plans for this Weds** (5-10 min)

- Historically we have just showed up to the GSU pub and had Coders cover the first pitcher - are we good to do that again?
- Things tend to develop from there if needed, e.g. folks head over to a restaurant on Spadina about an hour in if needed

2. **Debrief/Semester wrap up** (20 min)

- Lessons first -
    - How did we feel about the hybrid format? Thoughts from each individual person
    - Thoughts on lesson frequency/content
- Co-working
    - Summary of thoughts from co-working coordinators (format, experience, attendance, advertising, etc)
    - Had a meeting with Sophie about this, but what does the room think we collectively can/should do for co-working from here on out?
        - Some meeting sticking points - collaborating with UofT/UTM libraries, being more about help and aiming at beginners

3. **Considerations for next semester** (10 min)

- Survey updates (I can send out the survey to execs and it can be modified as needed)
- Format preferences (online/in-person/hybrid lessons/co-working events, lesson frequency/location, etc)

4. **'The state/future of Coders'** (5-10 min)

- can we sustain Coders in its current form past this year? 
    - if not, how can we put things in place (e.g. with the library?) to ensure that the mission lives on?) 

5. **Miscellaneous**

- any other matters arising
