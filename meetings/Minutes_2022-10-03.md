## Meeting Agenda, Oct 3 2022

Present: Madeleine, Vicki, Sophie, Ahmed, Yeshoda, Margot, Elliott

Regrets: n/a

1. **New exec onboarding** (5-10 min)

- Which new execs need one on one meetings and/or further support to adjust to their new roles?
- Brief discussion of new/re-introduced roles: Marketing Coordinator, Co-working coordinator
    - need to give Yeshoda passwords to socials 
    - need to set up meeting with Frances re: marketing
    - need to set up meeting b/w Madeleine and Amin - and hand off chequebook 
- Formalizing co-working coordinator role description
    - Margot: organizing and running regular co-working events 
    - Sophie: good with me! 

2. **Upcoming fall plans** (20-30 min)

- Remote vs in person - how do we want to run the semester? Some considerations:
    - co-working and lessons could have different formats (eg one could be online, one not)
    - if lessons are in person, could have them streamed on Discord too instead of the third party YouTube solution we found
    - recording lesson VODs is a concern if so - one solution is to have someone record them from Discord as they happen and upload after
    - Coders council is spread across campuses and making it to MADLab regularly might be difficult
- Margot: for lessons, having them be at least partly or fully online feels like a good model
    - re: coworking, online is nice but mostly an accountability space
    - having things mostly online means folks from both campuses can access events much more easily
- Madeleine: moving setup to go to a lesson can be difficult as well, many people have a nice desk setup they're used to
- Sophie: counterpoint - having people learn coding with you can be very powerful and helpful, could find a way to do both as a compromise
    - co-working could be online one week and in-person the week after, etc
    - could personally do one week online, one week in person, and then alternate from there
- Margot: with coworking, it's helpful for there to be a regular sched cause ideally you get regulars from that
    - it's really useful for there to be some designated timeslots as a consequence
    - could also do a hybrid thing, where the coworking leader can have discord open while meeting up in person 
    - but hybrid stuff can be complicated and can involve messy setups (consider microphones) 
- Review of lesson format/intro for new execs
- Who wants to teach what?
    - Madeleine: interested in teaching intro Python stuff, but would love to do something like a classic ML thing
        - could do a second lesson next semester, esp for valuable stuff year after year
    - Margot: whether this semester or next, would love to do functional/modular code in tidyverse 
        - could also do pandas in Python 
    - Yeshoda: data viz lesson, whether with ggplot2 or seaborn
    - Sophie: writing SQL using R, and could quickly reformulate that for Coders - next semester could be a how to clean your data lesson (search for missing values, fix column names) 
    - Vicki: could do a lesson on project workflows eg in R 
        - next semester though! 
- Proposed lesson schedule:
    - week of Oct 17 - Margot - pandas (w/ assist from Madeleine) 
    - week of Oct 31 - Yeshoda - data viz
    - week of Nov 14 - Sophie - SQL with R
    - week of Nov 28 - Margot - tidyverse functions
    - social on week of Dec 5! 
- Implementing peer teaching review - more next meeting
