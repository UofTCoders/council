## Meeting Agenda, Oct 3 2022

1. **New exec onboarding** (5-10 min)

- Which new execs need one on one meetings and/or further support to adjust to their new roles?
- Brief discussion of new/re-introduced roles: Marketing Coordinator, Co-working coordinator
- Formalizing co-working coordinator role description

2. **Upcoming fall plans** (20-30 min)

- Remote vs in person - how do we want to run the semester? Some considerations:
    - co-working and lessons could have different formats (eg one could be online, one not)
    - if lessons are in person, could have them streamed on Discord too instead of the third party YouTube solution we found
    - recording lesson VODs is a concern if so - one solution is to have someone record them from Discord as they happen and upload after
    - Coders council is spread across campuses and making it to MADLab regularly might be difficult
- Review of lesson format/intro for new execs
- Proposed lesson schedule:
    - week of Oct 17
    - week of Oct 31
    - week of Nov 14
    - week of Nov 28
    - social on week of Dec 5! 
- What are our thoughts on co-working formats/frequency?
- Implementing peer teaching review

3. **Miscellaneous** (5 min)

- any other matters arising
