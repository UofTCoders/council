## Meeting Agenda, Oct 11 2022

Present: Madeleine, Yeshoda, Ahmed, Elliott

Regrets: Sophie, Margot

1. **Constitution updates** (5 min)

- ULife has requested a few small changes to our constitution - need to review
- minor formalization of voting changes (eg only UofT students can vote in elections)
- will resubmit constitution with these things formalized

2. **Finalizing lesson format** (20 min)

- Deciding remote vs in person for this semester
    - Pros for remote
        - Much easier to run logistically
        - Fewer accessibility concerns (and safer overall) 
        - Fewer tech concerns (e.g. anyone can share their screens onto Discord, no hardware required)
        - Live support is a bit easier (learners can ask questions in chat)
        - Easier for people on different campuses to get to
    - Pros for in-person
        - Overall experience of seeing other people and/or a live instructor is a bit better
        - Could be better for beginners to be surrounded by other learners
        - Brings a bit of consistency if co-working is partially held in person
        - Some light networking opportunities - people can meet one another
- Thoughts
    - Madeleine - under assumption things would be online, but perhaps could do a hybrid thing
        - hybrid can be harder and the host would take on different responsibilities
    - Elliott - online worked well, but so does in person - so it really depends on availability
        - if instructors can't make it downtown that's not great, but we're used to teaching online to 'no one'
        - echoing that hybrid could be nice in seeing other people, but it could feel strange to not have the instructor there
    - Vicki - it's easier as instructors to be online, but feels that many people wanting to attend might really prefer in person
        - hybrid option could be good, but someone from Coders needs to be there, but could require more hosts 
    - Yeshoda - learning code with people in person is really good for beginners + people struggling
        - but if we're having sessions at MADLab and UTM then we should also do something for the UTSC students - but if things are hybrid/online that solves the issue
    - Vicki - would be good to have one host online and one in person
- takeaways/consensus - hybrid approach, much like past Coders experience, with lessons in person and streamed over Discord
    - lesson 1 will have an in-person and an online host anyways given the set up, so it'll be a test drive for having two hosts
    - need to reach out to each individual instructor about whether they're okay with teaching in person - schedule doesn't have to be 100% consistent
    - Yeshoda lesson will be in person at UTM - need to reach out to CDRS folks here 

3. **Miscellaneous** (5 min)

- organizing MADLab meeting for co-working/lessons? 
- getting MADLab key from Haidy - Ahmed will reach out
