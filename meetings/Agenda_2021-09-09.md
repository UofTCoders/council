## Meeting Agenda, Sept 9 2021

1. **Upcoming fall plans** (20-30 min)
 * So we were too burnt out to get the summer off the ground, but we're back on Ulife now at least, which means elections are a go! 
 * Elections + a welcome back social! Could this be held in person at an outdoor venue? 
 * Fall schedule - email out topic survey or predetermine 'standard' topic series with a few extras? 
 * Holding lessons online this fall just to be safe - RGASC at UTM is doing the same
 * Co-working? Lightning demo sessions? 
 * Peer mentorship? 

2. **New execs** (5-10 min)
 * We had a few names for this - Jennifer? Vicki? Anyone else? 
 * Any potential role shuffling among us on exec? 
 * Anyone thinking of any novel roles we might make?

3. **Format** (5-10 min)
 * Are we good to start running lessons on Discord instead of Zoom? 
 * Feedback form at beginning this time? 
 * If lessons return to back in person, how do we handle feedback? (Maybe a question for a future meeting...)
 * Updates to spiel to define the role and limitations of Coders better? 
 * Starting promptly at 6 (based on last meeting)

3. **Miscellaneous** (5 min)
 * Are we running any Carpentries events in the fall? 
 * Other business
