## Meeting Agenda, Oct 11 2022

1. **Constitution updates** (5 min)

- ULife has requested a few small changes to our constitution - need to review

2. **Finalizing lesson format** (20 min)

- Deciding remote vs in person for this semester
    - Pros for remote
        - Much easier to run logistically
        - Fewer accessibility concerns (and safer overall) 
        - Fewer tech concerns (e.g. anyone can share their screens onto Discord, no hardware required)
        - Live support is a bit easier (learners can ask questions in chat)
        - Easier for people on different campuses to get to
    - Pros for in-person
        - Overall experience of seeing other people and/or a live instructor is a bit better
        - Could be better for beginners to be surrounded by other learners
        - Brings a bit of consistency if co-working is partially held in person
        - Some light networking opportunities - people can meet one another

3. **Miscellaneous** (5 min)

- organizing MADLab meeting for co-working/lessons? 
- getting MADLab key from Haidy
