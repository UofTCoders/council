## Meeting agenda Sept 7th, 2023

Topics to discuss:
1. **New exec onboarding** (5-10 min)
- How are execs adjusting to their new roles?
- Do any execs need more support in where they are?
- Updating the website with your info!

2. **RGASC Merger** (15-20 min)
- Team update, where are we at and where are we going
- RGASC’s Graduate Professional Development Conference (GPDC). We have a timeslot on Wednesday, October 11 from 10:10 a.m. – 11:10 a.m. to introduce the Academic Workflow. Vicki is heading it but if you'd like to get involved by all means!

3. **Term Workshop Schedule** (20-25 min) 
- Review of lesson format/intro for new execs
- What format for the term? Online, in-person, hybrid?
  - Should we continue how we normally do at the MADLab? Or shall we switch more to UTM given the merger?
- How many and which lessons should we have?
  - When are execs free to host lessons? Typically workshops are on Wednesdays at 6pm, but we can change this time depending on our schedules
  - What topics do we want to focus on for the semester? We can start with the good old intro R, intro python workshops or come up with an AI lesson as well
  
4. **Misc** (5 mins)
- any other matters arising
