###	Finances

The Treasurer shall keep records of all income and expenses. The Treasurer shall present the group's financial health when requested and at a minimum once a year. 

The group's executive or members may not engage in activities that are essentially commercial in nature. This is not intended to preclude the collection of membership fees to cover the expenses of the group, or of charges for specific activities, programs or events, or to prohibit groups from engaging in legitimate fundraising. 

However, the group will not have as a major activity a function that makes it an on-campus part of a commercial organization, will not provide services and goods at a profit when that profit is used for purposes other than those of the organization, and will not pay salaries to some or all of its officers.

A majority of the executive council will take part in a twice-yearly internal review and audit of the finances and accounting. The goal of such review will be to maintain tidy and organized documentation surrounding the finances, to ensure integrity and accuracy of the financial condition of the organization, and to keep the executive members aware of the financial health of the organization. Audits shall take place every March and October of every year.

###	Meetings

**A) Annual General Meetings (AGMs):**

The group shall hold general meetings at least once per year.

The Executive Committee will announce these dates two (2) weeks prior to holding the meetings.  These meetings are intended to go over the group’s annual activity plan, financial health and propose or vote on constitutional amendments, if any. 
Motions will require 2/3 majority of registered members in attendance for a vote to be cast. 
The motion with the most votes will be passed. 

**B) Workshops, Tutorials, Co-Working Sessions and Social Gatherings**

The group will hold events weekly, outside of holidays and agreed upon breaks in schedule, interchanging between coding workshops, tutorials, co-working sessions and social gatherings, termed Hacky Hour.
